            <p>After learning about class and culture in my sociology class, I found myself viewing the 2024 Thanksgiving season through a sharper lens. At Princeton, the buildup to the holiday begins weeks in advance. It starts with casual, seemingly innocent questions that carry far more weight than they appear to: "What are your plans for Thanksgiving?" What struck me this year wasn't just the answers, but the assumptions embedded in the question itself. Thanksgiving, I realized, isn't just a holiday; it's a cultural marker that reflects the complexities of class and belonging in ways we rarely acknowledge.</p>

            <p>Three weeks before the break, the chatter begins. Some students excitedly describe extravagant plans: flights to family estates, reservations at fine-dining restaurants, or reunions in places as distant as Paris or Italy. These stories roll out effortlessly, peppered with the kind of confidence that comes from never having to wonder whether travel is affordable or whether home is a place worth returning to. Meanwhile, others respond with vaguer answers, muttering something about "staying on campus" or "keeping it low-key." These aren't just answers—they're shields, deflecting attention from the reality that not everyone can participate in the holiday narrative.</p>

            <p>For many of us who stayed behind, the empty dining halls and quiet dormitories were as much a reminder of absence as they were a reprieve from the noise. The holiday reinforced what I'd been learning in class: that cultural rituals like Thanksgiving aren't universally accessible. They're shaped by class, steeped in assumptions of stability, tradition, and wealth. To celebrate Thanksgiving as it's commonly envisioned—a lavish meal surrounded by family, in a warm and welcoming home—requires resources not everyone has. Even the question "What are your plans?" assumes a level of privilege, a baseline expectation that there are plans to be had.</p>

            <p>Thanksgiving, in its idealized form, feels less like a celebration and more like a spotlight, making clear the gaps in class and culture that often go unspoken.</p>
